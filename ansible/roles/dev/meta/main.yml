# The dependecies contains tasks for installing development packages
# We also use this role to pre-bake packages in the OS image for our development
# environment.
#
# Note:
# - 'dev' role is run as part of devtest host-group which is invoked from 'contiv/build'
# and 'contiv/lab'. See those repos for details on the ansible invocation but the
# most noticable point is that they run the tasks tagged as 'prebake-for-dev'
# - Anything marked with tags 'prebake-for-dev' is installed when 'dev' role is run,
# so all that is needed for pre-baking certain binaries is to mark them with
# 'prebake-for-dev' tag in respective roles.
