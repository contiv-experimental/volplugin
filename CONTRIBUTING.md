## Contributing to volplugin

Patches and feature additions are totally welcome to volplugin!

If you have a patch to contribute to volplugin, please follow these guidelines:

* Sign your commits with `git commit -s`. Note that we live under an Apache
  license.
* Your comments should detail the directory they are affecting, as below. This
  makes it much simpler than `git log --stat` to determine what areas of a
  project a specific commit is referencing.
  * Example: `librbd: changed a widget`
* Please squash your commits per fix/feature, with a single commit message.

If you have trouble with the appropriate git commands to handle these
requirements, please let us know! We're happy to help.
