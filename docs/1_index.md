# Welcome!

[volplugin](https://github.com/contiv/volplugin) controls
[Ceph](http://ceph.com/) RBD devices with a master/slave model to orchestrate
the mounting (and cross-host remounting) of volumes scheduled with containers.
You can control docker to mount these volumes with a plugin, or you can (soon)
use schedulers, as well as docker-compose to manage your application alongside
Ceph volumes.

This documentation is for the users and administrators of volplugin. If you
wish to learn more about the project for development purposes, please see 
[the README](https://github.com/contiv/volplugin/blob/master/README.md)
for more information.
